## Description 
My motivation for this website was to generate a random password using different characters.
I built this website for users to generate a random password.
Throughout the creation of this webpage I learned how to prompt and confirm questions regarding the criteria a person may want in their random password including uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols. 

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
To use this website, click on "Generate Password" You will then be asked how many characters you would like in your random password; enter a number within 8 and 128. If you enter a number that is less than 8 or more than 128 you will be told that you need to enter a password within the given range and start again. Once you have entered a password length you will then need to confirm whether or not you want your password to have uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers, or symbols. Once you have done this a random generated password should appear, but I could not get it to give an output. I have played around with it and have gotten undefined as an output, and now at the end it is blank with no output.
